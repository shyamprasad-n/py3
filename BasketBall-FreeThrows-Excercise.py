## Section 4 Homework data
#Dear Student,
#Welcome to the dataset for the homework exercise.
#**Instructions for this dataset:**
#You have only been supplied vectors. You will need to create the matrices yourself.
#Matrices:
#    - FreeThrows
#- FreeThrowAttempts

#Challenge
#You need to create three plots that portray the following insights:
#   • Free Throw Attempts per game
#   • Accuracy of Free Throws
#   • Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws*
#       *Each Free Throw is worth 1 point

#Create funtion for plot
